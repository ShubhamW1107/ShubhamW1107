## 🚀 About Me 
I'm a data analyst passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights that drive smarter business decisions. I specialize in transforming complex, messy datasets into clear, compelling stories that stakeholders can actually use.

My work focuses on building dashboards that don’t just look good but get used. I enjoy automating repetitive processes, optimizing SQL queries for performance, and developing data models that support strategic planning and long-term growth.

I’m particularly interested in solving real-world business problems across sales, operations, and customer analytics. Nothing excites me more than the moment when data uncovers insights that drive meaningful business decisions.

Outside of data, I enjoy watching movies, playing badminton, which helps me stay curious and continuously learning.
